## phyloglmstep: R package for stepwise selection of phyloglm models

The package provides a single method, `phyloglmstep`, which provides AIC-based
selection of phylogenetic generalized linear models. As such, it is a simple
extension on the [phylolm](https://github.com/lamho86/phylolm) package and 
provides behaviour analogous to the `phylolm::phylostep` function.

### Installation

Install `phyloglmstep` from `github`:
```{r}
devtools::install_github("naturalis/phyloglmstep")
```
